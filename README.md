# Newscrawler

Newscrawler is a software developed by the CColon-team in the context of the lecture "Softwareprojekt" by the University of Konstanz in the summer term 2016.

The team consisted of Claudio Spener, Franziska Schlor, Jonathan Hassler and Moritz Bock.

Its goal is to download the HTML-source of news-articles on multiple sites given by multiple URLs.
In this context, a news-article is a collection of multiple articles (as for example on most index pages).
