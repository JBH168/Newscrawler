# Newscrawler

Newscrawler is a software developed by the CColon-team in the context of the lecture "Softwareprojekt" by the University of Konstanz in the summer term 2016.

The team consisted of Jonathan Hassler (@JBH168), Franziska Schlor (@franziscl), Matt Sharinghousen (@msharing), Claudio Spener (@claudeeee) and Moritz Bock (@movabo).

Its goal is to independently crawl multiple domains, recognise news-articles and download their html-source.
Furthermore, it saves meta data to a database and is able to keep a downloaded collection of news-articles up to date.
